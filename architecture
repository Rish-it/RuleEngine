Theory: The Rule Engine with AST project is designed to evaluate user eligibility based on a set of dynamic rules defined by the user. The architecture is modular and consists of multiple components that facilitate rule creation, combination, evaluation, and storage.

Key Components:-
Frontend (Next.js Application):
User Interface: Provides a UI for users to create rules, combine them, and evaluate them against input data.
API Integration: Communicates with the backend via API endpoints for rule management.

Backend (Next.js API Routes):
Rule Creation API: Accepts rule strings from the frontend, validates them using Zod, and converts them into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) before storing them in the database.
Combine Rules API: Accepts an array of rules, combines their AST representations, and returns the combined AST.
Evaluate Rules API: Evaluates the combined AST against provided user attributes to determine eligibility.

Database (PostgreSQL with Prisma):
Stores rules and their corresponding AST representations, ensuring persistence and easy retrieval.
Provides an interface for the backend to interact with the data using Prisma ORM.

Business Logic:
AST Generation: Converts rule strings into an AST format, allowing for structured evaluation.
Rule Evaluation Logic: Implements the logic to evaluate rules based on different operators (e.g., >, <, ==) and handles combined rules.
